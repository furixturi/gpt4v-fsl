# GPT4V Few-shot Learning 

**gpt4v_fsl** is a utility package that helps you quickly test out if few-shot learning on GPT4 vision model gives you better results. 

It saves you the complexity of composing few-shot examples into the expected prompt message payload, then constructing and sending the inference calls.

Further more, it helps you quickly and easily compare few-shot with zero-shot and one-shot results, using concurrency to save you time.

For more details, check the samplel notebook [gpt4v_fsl.ipynb](./gpt4v_fsl.ipynb)

To see how to use it in your own Python script (without Jupyter notebook), check out the example [gpt4v_fsl_test.py](./gpt4v_fsl_test.py).
